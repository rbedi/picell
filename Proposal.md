Responsibility: Complete the project.

## Goals of the Project

Build a peer-to-peer wireless network between 3(+) Raspberry Pis over 434 MHz radios. 

Implement & compare the efficacy of two transmission protocols: 

1. Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
2. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

A working CDMA implementation will require time synchronization between the transmitters, which may be exceedingly challenging to do in a purely ad-hoc network. In the event that this proves prohibitively difficult, I will implement truly peer-to-peer CSMA, while utilizing a client/server architecture for the CDMA variant. 

Characterize the optimal bitrate and transmission protocol to maximize bandwidth for each implementation.
